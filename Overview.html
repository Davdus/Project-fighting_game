            <h3>Introduction of the introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome. This entire website serves as an introduction to fighting games.
                We will be looking at the things which make a fighting game a fighting game.
                And while they look alike from an unschooled third person view, every fighting game is drastically different from another.
                If you play one you won't magically be able to play every fighting game.
                Every fighting game require practice, dedication and patience.
                Fortunately, they all have some things in common.

            <h4>The Generic</h4>
            <p>
                You, player 1, fight against an opponent, player 2, in a 2D or 3D environment.
                You win by damaging the opponent, or to be more precise, by inputting button combinations to throw out attacks, throws etc., your execution.
                Just as important, if not more, are their defensive options.
                Those vary from game to game, but it is always a combination of movement and blocking.<br>
                <br>
                In most fighting games a health bar is used to display how close you are to losing or winning the round.
                Generally speaking you don't want to lose health of course,
                but many games have some kind of "rage" mechanic that is tied to your health,
                meaning if you lose a certain amount of health you get some benefit to turn things around.<br>

        <div class="genericNeutral">
            <h4>The Neutral</h4>
            <p>
                Every fighting game has a "neutral". It occurs whenever none of the two players have
                an advantage over the other, meaning they are both in the middle of the map,
                have roughly the same amount of health and are mentally composed.
                Depending on the mindset of the player and on the game and its characters
                the neutral game can vary from approach attempts to keep out.<br><br>
                <strong>You cannot just run in and throw out attacks without thinking.
                That will only result in you getting punished and comboed without end.</strong><br>
                <br>
                In some games you use projectiles to make the enemy approach,
                in others you apply "footsies", which involves good movement and spacing to interrupt or punish enemy attacks.
                If you "win the neutral", you then have more options than the enemy (mix ups, combo potential, setups) and therefor gain the advantage.
                Generally a very difficult topic for beginners, as these only focus on making cool combos and not on
                how they get to use a combo.

            <p>
                Essential for any fighting game.
                Good combos require composure, good execution and endless hours of practice.
                Not only that, but you need some kind of setup to even start a combo.

                <br><br>
                In an actual match, landing combos is your general goal within the round.
